  abstract = {During a Martian dust storm, the lower atmosphere is heated locally. Due to dynamical effects, the upper atmosphere and ionosphere can be lifted upward on a global scale by approximately 10 km. The connections between lower atmospheric dust events and associated ionospheric responses are poorly understood due to limited observations. Here, we present MAVEN Radio Occultation Science Experiment (ROSE) observations of ionospheric peak altitude during dust events in 2018 and 2016. In June 2018, a planet-encircling dust event arose from the Acidalia storm track in the northern hemisphere. Ionospheric peak altitudes at around 20{$^\circ$}S were normal in ROSE egress observations on 19 June and 22 June and then 10--15 km higher on 26 June and thereafter. Ionospheric peak altitudes at around 50{$^\circ$}N were also elevated in ROSE ingress observations, which began on 17 June. This suggests that the ionospheric peak altitude was affected by the dust event in the northern hemisphere before the southern hemisphere. We also observe evidence that smaller dust storms can trigger ionospheric responses: In July--October 2016, ionospheric peak altitudes at solar zenith angles of 54--70{$^\circ$} and latitudes of 50--80{$^\circ$}S were 20 km higher than expected. These observations were acquired during a modest ``A storm'' during a year without a global dust storm.}

  abstract = {Automatically searching for optimal hyper parameters is of crucial importance for applying machine learning algorithms in practice. However, there are concerns regarding the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness of current approaches when faced with the expensive function evaluations. In this paper, a novel efficient hyper-parameter optimization algorithm is proposed (called MARSAOP), in which multivariate spline functions are used as surrogate and dynamic coordinate search approach is employed to generate the candidate points. Empirical studies on benchmark problems and machine-learning models (e.g., SVM, RF, and NN) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to find relatively high-quality solutions for benchmark problems and excellent hyper-parameter configurations for machine-learning models using a limited computational budget (few function evaluations).}

  abstract = {Planetary scientists and space agencies are highly intrigued by the Martian ionosphere due to its significant impact on upcoming Mars missions. Given its potential influence on satellite communication and navigation systems, measuring the altitude distribution of electron density (ED) values in the Martian ionosphere becomes a vital parameter to consider. The parameter of electron density in the Martian ionosphere serves as a tool to represent and predict the impacts of severe space weather events and solar activity on the Martian ionosphere. This study presents the development of a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model, a deep machine learning algorithm to predict the Mars ionospheric ED values. To train and evaluate the model's performance, we employ data samples from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission. For the preparation of input variables in the Bi-LSTM model, approximately 5600 ED altitude distribution of electron density profiles logged by the MGS between the years 1998 to 2005, which corresponded to the major period of the 23rd solar cycle, are taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed model in predicting both quiet and disturbed times is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. The significant minimum values of MAE (0.56 109) and RMSE (0.67 109) for the quiet day considered and MAE (0.27 109) and RMSE (0.31 109) for the solar flare disturbed day considered indicate the fair performance of the Bi-LSTM based prediction model. This research's findings are vital for upcoming Mars missions, as precise predictions of ED of Mars ionosphere are crucial for reliable navigation and communication systems.}

  abstract = {Radio occultation observations of the ionosphere of Mars can span the full vertical extent of the ionosphere, in contrast to in situ measurements that rarely sample the main region of the ionosphere. However, most existing radio occultation electron density profiles from Mars were acquired without clear context for the solar forcing or magnetospheric conditions, which presents challenges for the interpretation of these profiles. Here we present 48 ionospheric electron density profiles acquired by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission (MAVEN) Radio Occultation Science Experiment (ROSE) from 5 July 2016 to 27 June 2017 at solar zenith angles of 54{$^\circ$} to 101{$^\circ$}. Latitude coverage is excellent, and comprehensive context for the interpretation of these profiles is provided by other MAVEN instruments. The profiles show a 9-km increase in ionospheric peak altitude in January 2017 that is associated with a lower atmospheric dust storm, variations in electron densities in the M1 layer that cannot be explained by variations in the solar soft X-ray flux, and topside electron densities that are larger in strongly magnetized regions than in weakly magnetized regions. MAVEN Radio Occultation Science Experiment electron density profiles are publicly available on the NASA Planetary Data System.}
