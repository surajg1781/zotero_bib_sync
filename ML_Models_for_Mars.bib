  abstract = {The plasma environment of Mars is highly influenced by its crustal magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate whether the crustal magnetic fields can be displaced from their original positions due to advection by ionospheric plasma flow. The ranges of interest are altitudes between km and solar zenith angles between . We examine magnetic field data using measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG) onboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft. We conduct statistical analyses ( years of data) in order to investigate if horizontal shifts are observed between the data and the crustal magnetic field model by Langlais et al. (2019), https://doi.org/10.1029/2018je005854. We also show two case studies of individual measurements within a specific region of Mars. The results show statistical and observational evidence that the crustal magnetic fields are often being advected towards the night-side of the planet. The displacement seems to increase exponentially as a function of altitude, reaching a horizontal shift of 100 km at 650 km altitude. Moreover, we use measurements from the SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition (STATIC) instrument in order to compare the dynamic pressure of ionospheric plasma flow to the magnetic pressure of the crustal magnetic fields. There are two possible causes for the displacement: a forcing by external magnetic pressure or an advection of the field to the electron fluid, which follows the ion fluid. In this paper, we argue that by the observed relation between ion fluid and displacement, the latter explanation is more probable.}

  abstract = {Gravity waves (GWs) and their associated multi-scale dynamics are known to play fundamental roles in energy and momentum transport and deposition processes throughout the atmosphere. We describe an initial machine learning model---the Compressible Atmosphere Model Network (CAM-Net). CAM-Net is trained on high-resolution simulations by the state-of-the-art model Complex Geometry Compressible Atmosphere Model (CGCAM). Two initial applications to a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability source and mountain wave generation, propagation, breaking, and Secondary GW (SGW) generation in two wind environments are described here. Results show that CAM-Net can capture the key 2-D dynamics modeled by CGCAM with high precision. Spectral characteristics of primary and SGWs estimated by CAM-Net agree well with those from CGCAM. Our results show that CAM-Net can achieve a several order-of-magnitude acceleration relative to CGCAM without sacrificing accuracy and suggests a potential for machine learning to enable efficient and accurate descriptions of primary and secondary GWs in global atmospheric models.},

  abstract = {Impact crater cataloging is an important tool in the study of the geological history of planetary bodies in the Solar System, including dating of surface features and geologic mapping of surface processes. Catalogs of impact craters have been created by a diverse set of methods over many decades, including using visible or near infra-red imagery and digital terrain models. I present an automated system for crater detection and cataloging using a digital terrain model (DTM) of Mars --- In the algorithm craters are first identified as rings or disks on samples of the DTM image using a convolutional neural network with a UNET architecture, and the location and size of the features are determined using a circle matching algorithm. I describe the crater detection algorithm (CDA) and compare its performance relative to an existing crater dataset. I further examine craters missed by the CDA as well as potential new craters found by the algorithm. I show that the CDA can find three--quarters of the resolvable craters in the Mars DTMs, with a median difference of 5--10\% in crater diameter compared to an existing database. A version of this CDA has been used to process DTM data from the Moon and Mercury (Silburt et al., 2019). The source code for the complete CDA is available at https://github.com/silburt/DeepMoon, and Martian crater datasets generated using this CDA are available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/MDKPC8.}

  abstract = {Automatically searching for optimal hyper parameters is of crucial importance for applying machine learning algorithms in practice. However, there are concerns regarding the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness of current approaches when faced with the expensive function evaluations. In this paper, a novel efficient hyper-parameter optimization algorithm is proposed (called MARSAOP), in which multivariate spline functions are used as surrogate and dynamic coordinate search approach is employed to generate the candidate points. Empirical studies on benchmark problems and machine-learning models (e.g., SVM, RF, and NN) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to find relatively high-quality solutions for benchmark problems and excellent hyper-parameter configurations for machine-learning models using a limited computational budget (few function evaluations).}

  abstract = {Traditional Martian bow shock and magnetic pileup (magnetopause) boundary models are based on the fitting of free parameters in a prescribed formula. The form of the formula, fitted data, and considered controlling parameters distinguish the individual models from each other. However, all these models have one thing in common: the shape of the boundary and the parametric dependence assumed are fixed by the prescribed formula. The fitted data set typically consists of individual identified boundary crossings. This approach can suffer from a significant bias, as the boundary crossings are more likely to be identified in regions where a spacecraft spends more time. In this study, we use an automated region classification of the data measured by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft to solar wind, magnetosheath, or magnetosphere. This is achieved by applying the Support Vector Machine method to individual spacecraft half-orbits (from periapsis to apoapsis or vice versa). Two different models of the locations of the bow shock and magnetic pileup boundaries are then constructed based on neural networks: i) a model trained using the classified data, and ii) a model trained using individual identified boundary crossings. As compared to formal empirical modeling efforts, the neural network models do not assume any prescribed shape/distance formula. Optimal model parameterization (considering the solar wind dynamic pressure, solar ionizing flux, crustal magnetic field magnitude, Alfv{\'e}n Mach number, and interplanetary magnetic field magnitude) is discussed and the model performance evaluated.}

  abstract = {Planetary scientists and space agencies are highly intrigued by the Martian ionosphere due to its significant impact on upcoming Mars missions. Given its potential influence on satellite communication and navigation systems, measuring the altitude distribution of electron density (ED) values in the Martian ionosphere becomes a vital parameter to consider. The parameter of electron density in the Martian ionosphere serves as a tool to represent and predict the impacts of severe space weather events and solar activity on the Martian ionosphere. This study presents the development of a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model, a deep machine learning algorithm to predict the Mars ionospheric ED values. To train and evaluate the model's performance, we employ data samples from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission. For the preparation of input variables in the Bi-LSTM model, approximately 5600 ED altitude distribution of electron density profiles logged by the MGS between the years 1998 to 2005, which corresponded to the major period of the 23rd solar cycle, are taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed model in predicting both quiet and disturbed times is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. The significant minimum values of MAE (0.56 109) and RMSE (0.67 109) for the quiet day considered and MAE (0.27 109) and RMSE (0.31 109) for the solar flare disturbed day considered indicate the fair performance of the Bi-LSTM based prediction model. This research's findings are vital for upcoming Mars missions, as precise predictions of ED of Mars ionosphere are crucial for reliable navigation and communication systems.}

  abstract = {Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is a primary energy input to the Mars atmosphere, causing ionization and driving photochemical processes above approximately 100 km. Because solar EUV radiation varies with wavelength and time, measurements must be spectrally resolved to accurately quantify its impact on the Mars atmosphere. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) EUV Monitor (EUVM) measures solar EUV irradiance incident on the Mars atmosphere in three bands. These three bands drive a spectral irradiance variability model called the Flare Irradiance Spectral Model (FISM)-Mars (FISM-M) which is an iteration of the FISM model by Chamberlin et al. (2007, 2008) for spectral irradiance at Earth. In this paper, we report the algorithms used to derive FISM-M and its associated uncertainties, focusing on differences from the original FISM. FISM-M spectrally resolves the solar EUV irradiance at Mars from 0.5 to 189.5 nm at 1min cadence, and 0.1 nm resolution in the 6--106 nm range or 1 nm resolution otherwise. FISM-M is suitable for both daily average and flaring spectral irradiance estimates and is based on the linear association of the broadband EUVM measurements with spectral irradiance measurements, including recent high time cadence 0.1 nm resolution measurements from the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Space Dynamics Observatory (SDO) between 6 and 106 nm. In addition, we present examples of model outputs for EUV irradiance variability due to solar flares, solar rotations, Mars orbit eccentricity, and the solar cycle, between October 2015 and November 2016.}
